# zeroforumsv2
### The goal of the ZeroForums project is to provide to anyone who wants a fully functioning and working website that most likely will still be maintained for a long time to come. Unlike Enjin were you would need to pay monthly, or other forum services were you would need to pay upfront to use the website at all. ZeroForums is completely free and open source.

## Some basic information?
* zeroforums (including version 2 and any other future versions) is a completely free, open source, website and forums system to be used for gaming communities by anyone.
* zeroforums version 1 was developed up until it's first beta release, sadly it died there. Version 2 is a **complete** rewrite of version 1, with many new methods and tricks being used to deliver a faster performing and a better enhanced product.

## How do I get set up?
* You need a MySQL database
* Change /phpscripts/getsql.php accordingly to your MySQL configuration.
* Run website, then go to index home page 'aka: /'. This will create all the PHP databases, initiate basic information such as default links and usertags, and will generate the default admin account with the username = "admin" and the password = "admin". Log onto this account and change the password (and username if you would like) as soon as possible or your website will be vulnerable!

## Who can I talk to about this project?
* ZeroByter (that is me)
